Import and export WordPress and WooCommerce users with full user meta, custom fields, billing & shipping details, and membership data. Supports CSV, XML, Excel, and TSV files.

== Description ==

The **User Import with Meta Add-on** extends the powerful WP Ultimate CSV Importer plugin to help you manage WordPress users and WooCommerce customers at scale. Whether you're migrating from another site, importing customers, or onboarding large user lists, this add-on gives you complete control over user profiles.

It supports importing data from various sources such as your computer, external URLs, cloud platforms like Google Sheets or Dropbox, FTP/SFTP locations.

This add-on allows you to import not only the standard WordPress user fields but also user meta, custom profile data, WooCommerce billing and shipping details, as well as metadata from popular membership plugins like **WP-Members** and **MemberPress**, making it ideal for eCommerce stores, membership sites, LMS platforms, and large business websites.

== Key Features ==

**Flexible Import Sources**
You can import user data from:
- Your desktop  
- FTP/SFTP servers  
- External URLs (Google Sheet / Dropbox)

**Supports Multiple File Formats**
Import from a wide range of file formats including:
- CSV  
- XML  
- Excel (XLS/XLSX)  
- TSV  
- Google Sheets  
- ZIP files containing structured data  

**Import WordPress Users and WooCommerce Customers**
Bring in new users with:
- Standard WordPress fields  
- User meta  
- WooCommerce billing and shipping information  
- Additional customer details like phone, address, notes, and more  

**Membership Plugin Compatibility**
Seamlessly import profile data for:
- WP-Members  
- MemberPress  

**Automatic Password Handling**
If your CSV (or other import file) doesn't include a password, the plugin generates a secure one and automatically emails it to the user.

**Smart Field Mapping**
Use an intuitive drag-and-drop interface or dropdown suggestions to map all your fields correctly. If your file headers and WordPress field headers are same, the plugin will automatically maps them. This makes large and complex imports easier and faster.

**Conditional Filters for Imports**
Apply filters to import only the specific users you want based on conditions like role, status, or any metadata, helping you maintain clean and organized data imports.

**Duplicate Handling**
Prevent duplicate user creation by validating user email.

Use update mode to modify existing users instead of creating new ones. (Pro feature)

**Iteration-Based Import**
Large files are split into smaller manageable chunks (iterations), ensuring that high-volume imports run smoothly without server timeouts.

**Monitor Import Progress**
Track import status in real time, view logs, and quickly resolve any issues. Errors are highlighted clearly for easy debugging.

The add-on is not only for importing, it also provides a full user export system.

**Export Users and WooCommerce Customers**
Export:

- All their meta fields  

**Multiple Export Formats**
Export your user data into file formats like:
- CSV  
- XML  
- XLS  
- XLSX  
- JSON  
- TSV  

**Iteration Export and Date-Based Export**
Export users in batches or export only users created during a specific time period.
